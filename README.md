The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight,
normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25),
overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).
